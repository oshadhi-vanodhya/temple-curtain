# Temple — a curtain of letters

An interactive instrument in React and three.js. Thirty-eight strands of letters —
about forty letters each — hang in the opening of a painted temple gateway like a
beaded curtain. Move the pointer near them and they heave aside; move it
*through* them and each strand you cross rings with a struck-metal chime and
carries a visible wave down its length, the letters tilting as it passes.

The sound is generated at runtime — no audio files. The only binary asset is the
painted backdrop.

## Run it

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:5173
npm run build    # production bundle into dist/
```

Sound sits behind a one-click gate on load. That is not decoration: browsers
start every `AudioContext` suspended and only a real user gesture may resume it.


## Notes

- Pointer events throughout, so it works with touch and pen as well as a mouse.
- Voices are capped at 56 and the ceiling is a safety valve, not a normal limit —
  one full sweep is 38 simultaneous voices and sweeps overlap.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is honoured for the UI animation.
